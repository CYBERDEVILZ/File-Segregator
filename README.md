<h1>File Segregator</h1>
<p>
  If you are facing from an organizational crisis and you put all the different files in the same folder without any sense of responisbility towards cleaning up your desktop or you are too lazy to do it. But you still have that urge to organize your files neatly into folders and make everything look neat and clean. In that case, don't fret as File Segregator has come to help you out.
  
  File Segregator is a program written in Python to segregate different files into folders, making the workspace look very neat and organized like a well maintained book rack in a library.
  
  The working is really simple and it comes with an easy to use Graphical User Interface. All you need is a few clicks and your cluttery, bestrewed mess will be taken care of.
